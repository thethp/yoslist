yoslist
=======

Get a yo when there is a new craigslist listing in your defined area.

Using the yoplait yo API wrapper [https://github.com/tec27/yoplait] and the craigslist json, this allows you to put in a rectangle made up of corner lat/long pairs you provide as well as a price and time interval to check, and whenever there is a new craigslist listing that matches your needs a "yo" is fired off to the account of your choosing to let you know.

To use simply copy config.sample.json, fill in all the information with your info, and run index.js
